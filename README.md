A simulation to test the Monty Hall Problem: A probability puzzle based on a game show
scenario. You pick one of three doors â€” one has a car, the others have goats. After your
choice, the host (who knows what's behind each door) opens one of the other two doors,
revealing a goat. You are then given a chance to switch. Should you?
